| Abstract | In this study, we addressed the influence of individual differences in personality traits measured trough a Big Five personality test, and sociodemographic variables such as age or gender, in the processing of words conveying discrete emotions. To this aim, we relied on data from a large-scale lexical decision task in Spanish. The analyses with linear mixed models revealed several interactions between emotional content and both personality traits and sociodemographic factors during word recognition. In this sense, there was a facilitation for fear-related words, mainly in male participants. Also, disgust interacted with agreeableness and conscientiousness, showing an inhibition for disgust-related words in participants scoring low in agreeableness or high in conscientiousness. Sadness-related words were processed more slowly in men, while this effect was absent in women. Finally, happiness-related words showed an interaction with openness to experience, age and gender. We discuss the complex interplay between the emotional connotation of words and individual differences. All in all, our findings emphasise the need to take individual characteristics into account when examining emotional word processing. |

| Abstract | Die Forschung zur Online-Sprachverarbeitung bei Lernern einer Zweitsprache ist ein wichtiger Teilbereich der Zweitspracherwerbsforschung. Die meisten Publikationen zu diesem Thema wenden sich jedoch an ein spezialisiertes Publikum. Die Beiträge dieses Sammelbands bieten jeweils zu einem Teilbereich der Forschung zur Sprachverarbeitung des Deutschen als Zweitsprache einen Überblick über aktuelle Forschungsfragen, Methoden und zentrale Befunde und präsentieren zum Teil auch neue empirische Ergebnisse. Inhaltlich werden Fragestellungen zum lexikalischen Zugriff und zur morphosyntaktischen Verarbeitung ebenso abgedeckt wie zur Diskursproduktion und -rezeption. Insgesamt bietet der Band dadurch einen für ein breiteres Publikum zugänglichen Überblick über die Sprachverarbeitungsforschung insbesondere zum Deutschen als Zweitsprache. |

| Abstract | This study examines how the cross-linguistic similarity of translation equivalents affects bilingual word recognition. Performing one of three tasks, Dutch–English bilinguals processed cognates with varying degrees of form overlap between their English and Dutch counterparts (e.g., lamp–lamp vs. flood-vloed vs. song-lied). In lexical decision, reaction times decreased going from translation equivalents without any cross-linguistic orthographic overlap to very similar but non-identical cognates. Identical cognates showed a large discontinuous processing advantage and were subject to facilitation from phonological similarity. In language decision, the effect of orthographic similarity reversed: a cognate inhibition effect arose, the size of which increased with orthographic similarity. Here identical cognates were markedly slower than other cognates. In progressive demasking, no orthographic similarity effect was found for non-identical cognates, but a semantic similarity effect arose. In addition, there was a facilitation effect for identical cognates of low English frequency. The task-dependent result patterns are interpreted in terms of four accounts of cognate representation and provide evidence in favor of a localist connectionist account. |

| Abstract | Numerous studies in psychology, cognitive neuroscience and psycholinguistics have used pictures of objects as stimulus materials. Currently, authors engaged in cross-linguistic work or wishing to run parallel studies at multiple sites where different languages are spoken must rely on rather small sets of black-and-white or colored line drawings. These sets are increasingly experienced as being too limited. Therefore, we constructed a new set of 750 colored pictures of concrete concepts. This set, MultiPic, constitutes a new valuable tool for cognitive scientists investigating language, visual perception, memory and/or attention in monolingual or multilingual populations. Importantly, the MultiPic databank has been normed in six different European languages (British English, Spanish, French, Dutch, Italian and German). All stimuli and norms are freely available at http://www.bcbl.eu/databases/multipic. |

| Abstract | We review recent evidence indicating that researchers in experimental psychology may have used suboptimal estimates of word frequency. Word frequency measures should be based on a corpus of at least 20 million words that contains language participants in psychology experiments are likely to have been exposed to. In addition, the quality of word frequency measures should be ascertained by correlating them with behavioral word processing data. When we apply these criteria to the word frequency measures available for the German language, we find that the commonly used Celex frequencies are the least powerful to predict lexical decision times. Better results are obtained with the Leipzig frequencies, the dlexDB frequencies, and the Google Books 2000–2009 frequencies. However, as in other languages the best performance is observed with subtitle-based word frequencies. The SUBTLEX-DE word frequencies collected for the present ms are made available in easy-to-use files and are free for educational purposes.
